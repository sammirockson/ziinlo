          <br />
          <br />Access & Correction <br />This section also applies to users resident in
          Argentina, Canada, India and Russia. You have the right to request access to
          your Personal Information we hold about you, how we use it, and who we share it
          with. We may not be able to provide you with certain Personal Information if
          providing it to you would interfere with another person's rights (e.g. where
          providing the Personal Information we hold about you would reveal information
          about another person). You also have the right to correct that information if it
          is inaccurate or incomplete. You can access and correct your Personal
          Information by logging into your Noomi account at any time. For example, you can
          delete certain Location Data via your device settings or the "Clear Location"
          option within Noomi. If you want us to correct your Personal Information that
          you are unable to correct using your account, please complete the request form
          here. Where we agree to correct your Personal Information, we will use
          reasonable steps to inform any third party to whom we have disclosed the
          relevant Personal Information so that they can rectify the Personal Information
          too.

          <br />Erasure <br />This section also applies to users resident in Argentina,
          Canada, India and Russia. You can delete your account, or remove certain
          Personal Information, by logging into your Noomi account and following the

          balance in your Weixin Pay or Noomi Pay account or are the administrator of an
          Official Account or Mini Program. If there is any other Personal Information you
          believe we process that you would like us to erase, please complete the request
          form here. You may request that we erase the Personal Information we hold about
          you where: you believe that it is no longer necessary for us to hold your
          Personal Information; we obtained your consent to process the Personal
          Information and you withdraw that consent (and we have no other valid legal
          grounds for processing the Personal Information); you believe we are unlawfully
          processing your Personal Information; or you are or were under the age of 16 (or
          such applicable age of majority under relevant local laws) when we collected the
          Personal Information and we can verify this. You may exercise your right to
          restrict our processing your Personal Information (as described below) whilst we
          consider a request to erase your data. We may retain the Personal Information if
          there are valid legal grounds for us to do so (e.g., for the defence of legal
          claims, freedom of expression or some other legal obligation) but we will let
          you know if that is the case. Where you have requested that we erase your
          Personal Information that we have made public and there are valid legal grounds
          for erasure, we will use reasonable steps to inform any third party to whom we
          have disclosed the relevant Personal Information so that they can erase it too.
          <br />
          <br />Restriction of Processing to Storage Only <br />This section also applies
          to users resident in Russia. You have a right to require us to stop processing
          your Personal Information other than for storage purposes in certain
          circumstances. However, we may process it if there are other valid legal grounds
          for us to do so (e.g., for the defence of legal claims or for another's
          protection). Where we agree to stop processing the Personal Information, we will
          use reasonable steps to inform any third party to whom we have disclosed the
          relevant Personal Information so that they can stop processing it too. You may
          request we stop processing and just store the Personal Information we hold about
          you where: you believe the Personal Information is not accurate (for the period
          it takes for us to verify whether it is accurate); we wish to erase the Personal
          Information as the processing is now unlawful (but you want us to retain the
          Personal Information and just store it instead); or we wish to erase the
          Personal Information as it is no longer necessary for our purposes (but you
          require it to be stored for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal
          claims).
          <br />
          <br />Portability <br />You have the right to receive a copy of certain of your
          Personal Information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.
          This comprises any Personal Information we process on the basis of your consent
          (e.g., Shared Information and content saved to Favorites) or pursuant to our
          contract with you (e.g., profile data), as described in the section "How do we
          use your information?". You can exercise your right to export your data by
          following the instructions here. You also have the right to request that we
          transfer that Personal Information to another party. If you wish for us to
          transfer the Personal Information to a third party, please ensure you detail
          that party. Note that we can only make such transfers where it is technically
          feasible. We are not responsible for the security of the Personal Information or
          its processing once received by the third party. Objection This section also
          applies to users resident in Russia. You may object to our use of your Personal
          Information that we use on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g., when we
          use your Personal Information to ensure account security). If you object to such
          processing, please complete this request form. To the extent provided by
          applicable laws and regulations, you may withdraw any consent you previously
          provided to us by following the instructions set out here.
